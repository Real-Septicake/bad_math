# Goal of bad_math
This is a library made with the express purpose and goal of creating a library where all of the operations either incrementing or decrementing by one at the lowest level. A less important goal is to make the process as inefficient 
as possible without resorting to complete inoperability or overusage of recursion to force stack overflows.
